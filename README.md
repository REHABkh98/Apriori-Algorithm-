# Apriori-Algorithm
## Introduction...
What is MBA?

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a technique that helps retailers identify the patterns of purchases that occur when various items are bought together. It uses statistical concepts such as support, confidence, lift to generate rules that can be used to interpret the purchase/shopping behavior,

## Association Rules ..
Apriori Algorithm is an algorithm for extracting the frequent item-sets with application in association rule learning. In general, the apriori algorithm has been developed to work on databases containing large number of transactions. For instance, purchases by customers of a store. The item-set is considered as ‘frequent’ if it meets a user-specified support threshold. For example, if the support threshold is set to 0.4, this indicates that a frequent item-set which is defined as a set of items that found together in at least 40% of all transactions in the database.

Association rules analysis can reveal how items are related to each other.
